## Description

This is a C++ code using Arduino framework for a flashed Ulanzi TC001 desktop clock, to display round timer countdown fetched from Best Coast Pairings for a particular tournament.

## History

I started this project in MicroPython, however in the midst of development I started to face the limits of such environment (available memory, etc). The only way to make this project successful was to scrap all the MicroPython code and start from square one in C++ using Arduino framework. Anyway, the original code in MicroPython can be still found in the the repository up to [commit f7929919](https://github.com/honzaskypala/bcp-clock/tree/f7299192a644fcca563c471fa8951567b8548e41) of this project, if you want to look into that for studying purposes.
